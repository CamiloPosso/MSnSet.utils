* small test case. for what? general purpose?
* documentation of srm_msnset
* adding tweaked heatmap.plus
* add normalization based on PCA eigenvectors
* .. add covariate removal (related to above)
* add power analysis to LM
* resolve conflict between outliers::outlier and randomForest::outlier
* there is a suspicion that rrollup causes some troubles with data. The troubles are detected with PCA plot.  It splits the data into two well-separated groups.  In contrast this is not visible with peptide-level data.
