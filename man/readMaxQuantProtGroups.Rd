\arguments{
\item{path}{character path to the folder containing "proteinGroups.txt file".
It should be in "{raw files folder}/combined/txt"}

\item{quantType}{character Defines pattern what type of column to
use for quantificaiton. 
E.g. "LFQ intensity" or "Ratio H/L normalized".}

\item{verbose}{numeric controls the text output}

\details{
So far uses only LFQ data as quantitative data. As feature data, only first
12 columns and iBAQ columns are used. Features are based on the genes.
In case of multiple proteins matching the same gene, only the one with
the highest iBAQ value is returned.

\note{
The "proteinGroups.txt" file can be compressed to save space.

It looks like the convention for column naming in MaxQuant is
      type of quantification followed by sample name separated by space.
      E.g. "LFQ intensity Sample1" or "Ratio H/L normalized Control33".
      In \code{quantType} you need to specify the full first component
      in the name that defines the type of quantification.

iBAQ option must be enabled in MaxQuant analysis because it is used
      to resolve ambiguity between two proteins matching one gene.
